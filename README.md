#### Description: The Snake Game is a simple but compelling project built with the Pygame library in which players control a snake as it moves through a grid, eating food, growing longer, and avoiding obstacles.The game environment consists of a rectangle screen with a black background, typically 800x600 pixels. The user uses arrow keys to direct the snake's movement and guide it to consume randomly presented food. Each time the snake eats food, its length increases, making it increasingly difficult to traverse without hitting with itself or the screen's bounds.The game's main challenge is avoiding self-collisions, which happen when the snake's head contacts any section of its body. Furthermore, if the snake touches the screen's bounds, the game is over. To add excitement and competition, the game includes a scoring system that increases as the snake consumes more food, as well as a scoreboard that displays the highest scores.Visually, the snake and food are represented by color blocks, with the snake rendered in green hues and the food in red. The game is fast-paced, with the snake moving in discrete steps, and the player must react rapidly to keep it from colliding with itself or the edges of the screen.Overall, this version of Snake is an entertaining blend of strategy, reflexes, and competition, providing a vintage feel while still including current elements such as leaderboards and score tracking.The game also has an introduction screen that displays the title and game options, such as playing, viewing the leaderboard, or quitting. After the game, the player is asked to enter their name, and their score is posted to the leaderboard. This allows players to compare their scores with others and increases the game's replayability.
